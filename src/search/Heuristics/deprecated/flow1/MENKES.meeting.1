* Merge prevail w/ ALL that is consumed
* PARTIAL_ENCODING=false solves driverlog/pfile8 but PARTIAL_ENCODING=true
  doesn't solve driverlog/pfile8. IDEA=use mutexes to streghten out the
  constraints of the LP (try to imitate PARTIAL_ENCODING=true). In driverlog,
  the heuristic for init degrades a lot: pfile8 goes from 21 to 15.
* Run experiments with bare LP + merging (without landmarks)

AGENDA

* Run by merging prevails w/ consumed
* Handle second point above (DONE)
* Zeno: merge fuel level w/ airplane location granted by unique property
  in causal graph: FUEL only connected w/ LOCATION
* Can check before-hand that new constraint of a merge is satisfied by
  current solution. If so, skip to next merge.
* compute landmarks once per state
